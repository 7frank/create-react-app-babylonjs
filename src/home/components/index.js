    <p>There are examples for Virtual Reality, 3D models, 3D UI controls, Skybox and mesh creations using BabylonJS on WebGL running in a React App.</p>

    <p>Interesting part is the UI 2D, where a WebGL texture is dynamically updating from props - best experienced in VR mode :)</p>

    <p>
    Also, full HMR experience with browser udpating while you build your application.
